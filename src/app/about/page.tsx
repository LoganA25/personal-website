              My names Logan, and currently I&apos;m a data analyst/engineer at a
              small health facility where I specialize in building systems that
              transform complex data into clear insights. When I&apos;m not at
              work, I love learning new things in software development and
              taking on new challenges. One of my favorite things to do is
              collaborate with people on projects!
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of work and learning, I&apos;m a big fan of video games. I
              spend some of my downtime playing with friends. It&apos;s my
              favorite way to relax and have fun!
            </p>

              At home, I&apos;m kept company by two dogs and a cat, and
              supported by my wonderful wife. An interesting fact about me, I
              always sneeze twice!
            </p>

              Thanks for stopping by! I&apos;m always open to discussing
              technology, gaming, or anything else you might find interesting.
              Feel free to reach out!
